# I-LOFAR-scripts
This repository conatins scripts and commands used during my internship with I-LOFAR and BL. The scripts were used to process data from a range of sources including FRB, pulsars, and SETI searches. A user guide for I-LOFAR backend (REALTA) in pdf form is also included. Each data processing task that I completed has a corresponding report also included in this repository.
